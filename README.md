## Vienna Subway Network Analysis
# Abstract
Austria's city, Vienna, has a high population. The population thickness of Vienna is also essentially high. As the populace is high, numerous individuals possess vehicles driving leads to traffic jams and the failure to commute from one location to another. Through the examination of the Vienna Subway Network, we are able to foresee the foremost congested places(nodes) and propose a few measures to decrease the blockage and make it simple to commute. Traffic decrease benefits all other angles associated with it such as time viability, fuel wastage, etc. It moreover advances maintainability for future eras.The examination shows the centrality measures such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality of the full network, and centrality with regard to a single hub. The computation is done by taking each station within the Vienna subway outline as hubs and the associations as edges.Utilising the above traditions, an arrangement is formed and the centrality measures are computed for further analysis. Based on what comes about, the hub with the most elevated centrality degree is the foremost congested network, meaning that numerous individuals commute in that network which hub must be decongested. The traffic from these nodes can be redirected to those nodes which have a low esteem of centrality degree. This process is more than once done in these hubs till the centrality esteem of the network is altogether lesser than the initially gotten centrality value.Measures such as edge betweenness and betweenness of the nodes can be utilised to distinguish the key station within the network. Eigenvalue centrality can be utilised to back our conclusions. Division of networks into communities in our situation can be utilised to analyse subsets of the network. All simulations, calculations, and visualisations were about to be done by utilising the Gephi tool. The Vienna Subway data was collected from the Kaggle. The dataset consists of four attributes that provide info about the stations and their connections.
